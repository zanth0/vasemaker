# Vasemaker

A light, browser-native 3D vase generator built with pure JavaScript and WebGL. Create and customize vases in real-time without plugins or dependencies. Optimized for Bambu Studio spiral vase printing.

## Why Did I Build This?

- I'm a mechanical engineer and 3D printing hobbyist and am trying to better understand the math behind 3D rendering. If you want advanced functionality, check out [Make my Vase](https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab/makeMyVase) from Bambu themselves. Though, you won't get the cool and unique vase shapes you can get with Vasemaker.

## Features
- Fully browser-native 3D modeling and preview
- Built with vanilla JavaScript and WebGL
- No installation or plugins needed
- Real-time parameter customization
- Direct STL export from browser
- Optimized for 3D printing with spiral vase mode

## Usage
1. Open in any modern browser 
2. Customize parameters via the built-in controls
3. Preview in real-time 3D
4. Export directly to STL

## Tech
WebGL for 3D rendering and vanilla JS for geometry generation. That's it.
